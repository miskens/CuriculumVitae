            <p>IÂ´ve played many different team games online. When I was younger I would enjoy playing by myself or with just a friend, and
                I enjoyed it but by chance I was introduced to team playing and I loved the fact that you need to accomplish
                things together.
            </p>
            <p>
                I play online with friends all around the world. I have played with people in most countries in the world through the years.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2001 I started a multinational clan that through a lot of practice became the nr.1 clan in the world in a mod of a game
                called Quake 3 Arena.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2006-2010 I was the leader of a very successful European guild of 80+ players in World of warcraft. We were players
                from about 10 different countries in Europe.
            </p>
            <p>Nowadays gaming is just a leisure hobby that I do when I find the time.</p>
            <p>
                I also play roleplaying tabletop games with friends around the world each week.
